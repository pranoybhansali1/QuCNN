              Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. The
              most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data
              executed on a quantum computer,
              i.e. quantum-enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense
              quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum
              systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program. This includes
              hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult
              subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed
              faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states
              instead of classical data. Beyond quantum computing, the term "quantum machine learning" is also
              associated with classical machine learning methods applied to data generated from quantum experiments
              (i.e. machine learning of quantum systems), such as learning the phase transitions of a quantum system or
              creating new quantum experiments.

          <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            Qiskit is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for working with quantum computers at the level of
            circuits, pulses, and algorithms. It provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and
            running them on prototype quantum devices on IBM Quantum Experience or on simulators on a local computer. It
            follows the circuit model for universal quantum computation, and can be used for any quantum hardware
            (currently supports superconducting qubits and trapped ions) that follows this model.

            Qiskit was founded by IBM Research to allow software development for their cloud quantum computing service,
            IBM Quantum Experience.Contributions are also made by external supporters, typically from academic
            institutions.

            The primary version of Qiskit uses the Python programming language. Versions for Swift and JavaScript
            were initially explored, though the development for these versions have halted. Instead, a minimal
            re-implementation of basic features is available as MicroQiskit, which is made to be easy to port to
            alternative platforms.

          Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not
          require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other
          components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports
          extensions
          that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for
          object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and
          several common framework related tools.

          <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
          The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
          in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
          the appearance of the document.

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
          interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
          by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets, surround and provide information about
          document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
          not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

          <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
          written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
          HTML and JavaScript.

          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
          This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
          of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
          in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling
          the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
          formatting.

          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
          styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
          screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
          content is accessed on a mobile device.
